BAsicPlayerController Documentation

The Package Contains:

BasicPlayerController.cs
PlayerPlaceholder Prefab
Inventory Placeholder Image (Screnshoot006)
a TestScene with the aplied script

How to use

1. add the basicPlayerController Script to your PlayerObject (the player object needs at the moment at least one camera and a playerUI canvas see TestScene)
2. add the canvas items for the Inventory and Escape Menu to the PlayerObject in the BasicPLayerController Script Component
2.a. if you have buttons to close the menus you have to link them to the Controller Script ... to do so:
	- select the button that closes the menu in the scene history 
	- in the inspector in the button component add an On Click() event
	- select the playerObject as Object (or the object you applied the BasicPlayerControllerScript to)
	- under function look for BAsicPlayerControllerScript and select the CloseMenu function within it
	- drag´n drop the menuCanvas that should be closed in the function variable field
3. enjoy 
a.) - you have the option to allow the player pawn to be moved while a menu is open, standard behavior = not allowed
	- you can also restrict the players abilitty to move while he is in midair by unchecking the Allow Mid Air Movement Flag, though i would not recommend at the moment becouse the phisycs don´t check out at the moment and the behaviour is kind of strange
